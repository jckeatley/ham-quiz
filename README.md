# Ham Quiz
This Play Framework app generates a random quiz, based on the latest FCC question
pools for the Technician, General, and Amateur Extra amateur radio licenses.
It randomly chooses one question from each group of questions in the pool,
and randomly orders the answers -- except when one of the answers must be last,
like "All of the above".  It then presents the quiz to the user.  If the user
gets a question wrong, the wrong answer will be tabulated, and the correct answer
displayed to the user.  There is no time limit imposed on completion of the quiz.

## Building
This is an sbt project, so sbt is used to build it.  It is packaged using
**SBT Native Packager**, the Docker Plugin.  To deploy the built project
as a docker image, run:

`$ sbt clean docker:publishLocal`

This will deploy as a docker image on the local machine.
